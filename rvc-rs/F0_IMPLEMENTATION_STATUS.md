### Basic F0 Extraction
```rust
use rvc_lib::{GUIConfig, RVC};

let cfg = GUIConfig::default();
let rvc = RVC::new(&cfg);

// Extract F0 using different methods
let (coarse, f0) = rvc.get_f0(&audio_signal, pitch_shift, "crepe");
```

### Harvest Direct Usage
```rust
use rvc_lib::Harvest;

let harvest = Harvest::new(16000); // 16kHz sample rate
let f0_values = harvest.compute(&audio_signal);

// Async version
let f0_values = harvest.compute_async(audio_signal).await;
```
