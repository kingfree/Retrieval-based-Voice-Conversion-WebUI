INFO: pip is looking at multiple versions of hydra-core to determine which version is compatible with other requirements. This could take a while.

The conflict is caused by:
    fairseq 0.12.2 depends on omegaconf<2.1
    hydra-core 1.0.7 depends on omegaconf<2.1 and >=2.0.5

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict
